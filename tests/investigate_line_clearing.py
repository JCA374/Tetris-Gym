Based on the tests above, the issue is likely:

1. If max row fullness < 10:
   ‚Üí Pieces die before filling a complete row
   ‚Üí Need to adjust game difficulty or piece placement strategy

2. If pieces aren't being placed:
   ‚Üí Action mapping is wrong
   ‚Üí Check tetris-gymnasium documentation

3. If lines are cleared but reward=0:
   ‚Üí Reward structure issue
   ‚Üí Check reward_mapping in environment config

Next steps:
- Review the test outputs above
- Check tetris-gymnasium version: pip show tetris-gymnasium
- Consider using a simpler Tetris environment (gym-tetris)
