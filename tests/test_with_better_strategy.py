The issue is clear: Random actions don't spread pieces horizontally!

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
- Action 5 (hard drop) places piece in current column
- Without moving LEFT/RIGHT first, pieces stack in same spot
- Game ends after 3-5 pieces before any row fills

YOUR AGENT MUST LEARN TO:
1. Move pieces horizontally (actions 0=LEFT, 1=RIGHT)
2. THEN drop (action 5)
3. Balance piece placement across all columns

This is actually good news - it means:
✅ Environment works correctly
✅ Your agent just needs better action selection
✅ Reward shaping should encourage horizontal movement

RECOMMENDED FIXES:
1. Add reward for horizontal distribution
2. Penalize placing pieces in already-full columns
3. Increase exploration time (slower epsilon decay)
4. Use action masking to prevent bad drops
