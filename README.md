# TETRIS AI - LINE CLEARING FIX

## üéØ Problem Identified

Your Tetris AI wasn't clearing lines because of **incorrect action mappings**. The agent was using `random.choice([0, 1])` thinking these were LEFT and RIGHT actions, but in tetris-gymnasium:
- Action 0 is likely NOOP (no operation)
- Action 1 is LEFT
- Action 2 is RIGHT

This caused pieces to stack in the middle (columns 3-6) while the sides stayed at height 2, preventing any rows from filling completely.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Action Discovery** (`config.py`)
- Added automatic action discovery from the environment
- Defines proper action constants (ACTION_LEFT, ACTION_RIGHT, etc.)
- Tests actions empirically if the environment doesn't provide meanings

### 2. **Smart Exploration** (`src/agent.py`)
- Fixed exploration to use correct LEFT/RIGHT actions
- Added "lateral movement streaks" - agent moves 2-5 steps horizontally
- Early training focuses 60% on horizontal movement discovery
- Progressive exploration strategy that adapts over training phases

### 3. **Line Counter Fix** (`train.py`)
- Checks multiple possible keys: 'lines_cleared', 'number_of_lines', 'lines', etc.
- Will automatically find and use the correct key

### 4. **Better Reward Shaping** (`src/reward_shaping.py`)
- Added horizontal distribution bonus to encourage spreading pieces
- Reduced penalties to reasonable levels
- Strong rewards for line clearing (500-10000 points)

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install tetris-gymnasium torch numpy matplotlib tqdm --break-system-packages
```

### 2. Test Action Mappings First
```bash
python test_actions.py
```
This will verify that LEFT/RIGHT actions work correctly.

### 3. Start Training
```bash
# Quick test (100 episodes)
python train.py --episodes 100 --log_freq 10

# Full training run
python train.py --episodes 10000 --log_freq 100 --save_freq 500 --reward_shaping balanced
```

### 4. Monitor Progress
Look for these key indicators:
- **"FIRST LINE CLEARED!"** message (should happen within 500 episodes)
- Column heights becoming more balanced (not just middle columns)
- Lines/Episode metric increasing over time

## üìä Expected Training Timeline

- **Episodes 0-100**: Agent discovers horizontal movement
- **Episodes 100-500**: First lines start getting cleared
- **Episodes 500-1500**: Consistent 1-3 lines per episode
- **Episodes 1500-5000**: 5-10 lines per episode
- **Episodes 5000+**: Advanced play, 20+ lines per episode

## üîç Debugging If Still No Lines

If lines still aren't clearing after 500 episodes:

1. **Check action test results**:
   ```bash
   python test_actions.py
   ```
   Should show pieces on left/right sides, not just center.

2. **Check board statistics in training output**:
   - Look for "Column heights" - should NOT be [2,2,2,20,20,20,20,2,2,2]
   - Should see varied heights across all columns

3. **Verify environment info keys**:
   Add this debug line in train.py after env.step():
   ```python
   if episode < 5:
       print(f"Info keys: {list(info.keys())}")
   ```

4. **Try manual testing**:
   Create a simple script to manually test the environment and verify lines can be cleared.

## üí° Key Insights

The main issue was that random exploration with wrong action IDs (0,1 instead of 1,2) meant the agent never learned to move pieces horizontally. With the fixes:

1. **Correct action mappings** ensure LEFT/RIGHT actually move the piece
2. **Lateral movement streaks** help discover wall positions
3. **Distribution bonus** rewards spreading pieces horizontally
4. **Multiple line-counter keys** ensure we track clearing correctly

## üéÆ Good Luck!

Your Tetris AI should now start clearing lines! If you still have issues, the problem is likely one of:
- tetris-gymnasium version incompatibility
- Environment configuration issues
- Need for longer training

Run the test_actions.py script first to verify everything is working, then start training!
